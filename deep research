I want you to do a deep research and find out the on-shelf or, say, the date when these products became available for each of these partners. Also, tell me if there was any pre-order allowed and if the pre-order was allowed, tell me the pre-order start date and pre-order end date. Also, I want to know what was the launch promo. For example, say, for Pixel 9a, I think some of the retail partners were giving out Fitbit 9 as a free gift. For some of the previous launches, it was Pixel Buds. So, I want to know what was the launch promo for each of these retail partners. And I also want to understand what was the duration of the launch promo when it started and when it ended. Also, tell me about any other activity that the competitors, which are Samsung and Apple, were doing during the launch period of Pixel A-series phones. So, basically, I want information for each of these retail partners for Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and Pixel 7a. And give me all the above information I asked for in a tabular format for each of these retail partners and for each of these the phone model launches, that is, Pixel 9a, Pixel 8a, and Pixel 7a for each of these retail partners. Share your output in a tabular format. Also, in the same tabular format, add any other partner offers that were available with the launch and what was the start date and end date of the partner offers. For instance, Vodafone had offered, I think, some bundle package with free airtime with Pixel 8a launch. So, I want that kind of information as well. Give all the information in a tabular format. Share any interesting insights that you can gather. Do a deep research and prepare a very comprehensive report. I want everything to be very super accurate.
